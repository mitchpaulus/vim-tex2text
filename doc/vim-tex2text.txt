*vim-tex2text* Converts raw Latex source code to text file ready for
grammar editors.

This plugin is meant to take the raw Latex source file and turn it into
something that a grammar checker such as Grammarly can understand and parse.
The means that Latex commands need to be erased, modified, and adjusted to
make this happen. 

This is not meant to exactly reproduce what the PDF output would be in text
format. It is simply meant to edit the text so that grammar checkers can work
without manual effort. 

========================================================================
*Usage* 


To use, run the TexToText command. By default, this is mapped to 

<leader>ttt

standing for [T]ex [t]o [t]ext.

*Contributing* 


This is certainly a work in progress, and lots of different customizations
would be required to meet all persons needs. If you come across something,
please make an issue or pull request, so we can make this better!

========================================================================
*Bugs*

I am fully aware of the current limitations. This just grew out of personal
use, so please contribute if you'd like to work on this together!
